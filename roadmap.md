## Development Philosophy

Cirqa's development is guided by several core principles:

- **Security First**: Security is our highest priority in all development decisions
- **Community-Driven**: Development priorities are influenced by community feedback
- **Sustainable Growth**: Building for long-term success rather than short-term gains
- **Interoperability**: Creating seamless connections with the broader DeFi ecosystem
- **User Experience**: Making DeFi lending accessible to both novice and experienced users

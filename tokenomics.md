The CIRQA token is the governance and utility token of the Cirqa protocol. This document outlines the token's economic model, including its supply, distribution, utility, and value accrual mechanisms. The tokenomics are designed to align incentives between users, liquidity providers, and governance participants.

</div>

## Token Overview

- **Name**: Cirqa Token
- **Symbol**: CIRQA
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 CIRQA
- **Token Type**: ERC-20 on KiiChain
- **Decimals**: 18

## Token Distribution

The initial distribution of CIRQA tokens is designed to ensure fair allocation across various stakeholders:

| Allocation | Percentage | Amount | Vesting |
|------------|------------|--------|--------|
| Community Treasury | 30% | 300,000,000 | Controlled by governance |
| Protocol Incentives | 25% | 250,000,000 | Released over 4 years |
| Team & Advisors | 20% | 200,000,000 | 1-year cliff, 3-year vesting |
| Investors | 15% | 150,000,000 | 6-month cliff, 2-year vesting |
| Initial Liquidity | 5% | 50,000,000 | Unlocked at launch |
| Ecosystem Development | 5% | 50,000,000 | Released over 2 years |

<div class="cirqa-note">

The vesting schedules are designed to align long-term incentives and prevent market disruptions from large token unlocks. The Community Treasury is controlled by CIRQA token holders through governance votes.

## Token Utility

The CIRQA token serves multiple functions within the ecosystem:

### Governance

- **Proposal Power**: Hold CIRQA to create governance proposals
- **Voting Rights**: Vote on protocol changes, parameter adjustments, and treasury allocations
- **Delegation**: Delegate voting power to trusted community members

### Economic Incentives

- **Liquidity Mining**: Earn CIRQA by providing liquidity to supported markets
- **Borrowing Incentives**: Earn CIRQA by borrowing specific assets
- **Staking Rewards**: Stake CIRQA to earn a share of protocol fees

### Protocol Utility

- **Fee Discounts**: Stake CIRQA to receive discounts on borrowing and liquidation fees
- **Collateral Boosts**: Staked CIRQA may provide collateral factor boosts for other assets
- **Priority Liquidation Protection**: CIRQA stakers receive priority in liquidation protection mechanisms

## Value Accrual Mechanisms

CIRQA's value is designed to grow with protocol usage through several mechanisms:

### Fee Sharing

A portion of protocol fees is directed to CIRQA stakers:

- **Origination Fees**: One-time fees charged when borrowing assets
- **Interest Spread**: A percentage of the interest paid by borrowers
- **Liquidation Fees**: A percentage of liquidation penalties

### Supply Dynamics

CIRQA implements mechanisms to manage token supply:

- **Buyback and Burn**: A portion of protocol fees is used to buy back and burn CIRQA tokens
- **Emission Adjustments**: Governance can adjust emission rates based on market conditions
- **Deflationary Mechanisms**: Certain protocol actions may burn CIRQA tokens

## Staking Mechanics

Staking CIRQA provides several benefits:

- **Staking Tiers**: Different benefits based on amount staked
- **Staking Duration**: Longer staking periods provide enhanced rewards
- **Staking Multipliers**: Active participation in governance increases staking rewards

### Staking Tiers

| Tier | CIRQA Required | Benefits |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Bronze | 1,000 CIRQA | 5% fee discount, basic governance rights |
| Silver | 10,000 CIRQA | 10% fee discount, enhanced governance weight |
| Gold | 100,000 CIRQA | 20% fee discount, premium governance weight, collateral boost |
| Platinum | 1,000,000 CIRQA | 30% fee discount, maximum governance weight, maximum collateral boost |

## Emission Schedule

CIRQA tokens are released according to a predetermined schedule:

- **Year 1**: 40% of protocol incentives (100,000,000 CIRQA)
- **Year 2**: 30% of protocol incentives (75,000,000 CIRQA)
- **Year 3**: 20% of protocol incentives (50,000,000 CIRQA)
- **Year 4**: 10% of protocol incentives (25,000,000 CIRQA)

Emission rates can be adjusted through governance proposals based on market conditions and protocol growth.

## Treasury Management

The Community Treasury is a critical component of Cirqa's long-term sustainability:

- **Ecosystem Grants**: Funding for projects building on or integrating with Cirqa
- **Liquidity Incentives**: Strategic incentives for key markets
- **Protocol Insurance**: Reserves for potential shortfalls or emergencies
- **Marketing and Growth**: Resources for expanding the Cirqa ecosystem

All treasury expenditures are decided through governance votes by CIRQA token holders.

## Token Governance

CIRQA governance follows a structured process:

1. **Discussion**: Ideas are discussed in the community forum
2. **Temperature Check**: Informal polling to gauge community sentiment
3. **Formal Proposal**: On-chain proposal creation (requires minimum CIRQA holdings)
4. **Voting Period**: 7-day voting period for all CIRQA holders
5. **Implementation**: Successful proposals are implemented after a timelock period

For more details on governance, see the [Governance](governance.md) documentation.

## Economic Sustainability

Cirqa's tokenomics are designed for long-term sustainability:

- **Decreasing Emissions**: Gradually decreasing token emissions
- **Fee Generation**: Growing fee revenue as protocol usage increases
- **Value Capture**: Multiple mechanisms to capture value for token holders
- **Governance Adaptability**: Ability to adjust parameters as market conditions change

Tokenomics parameters may be subject to change through governance votes. Always refer to the latest documentation and governance proposals for the most up-to-date information.

The CIRQA token is the governance and reward token of the Cirqa scholarship platform. This document outlines the token's economic model, including its supply, distribution, utility, and value accrual mechanisms. The tokenomics are designed to align incentives between students, investors, and community participants who support educational funding.

## Token Utility

The CIRQA token serves multiple functions within the ecosystem:

### Governance

- **Proposal Power**: Hold CIRQA to create governance proposals
- **Voting Rights**: Vote on protocol changes, parameter adjustments, and treasury allocations
- **Delegation**: Delegate voting power to trusted community members

### Economic Incentives

- **Scholarship Funding Rewards**: Earn CIRQA by funding student scholarships with USDT
- **Rating Participation**: Earn CIRQA by participating in the community rating system
- **Staking Rewards**: Stake CIRQA to earn a share of protocol fees from scholarship funding

### Protocol Utility

- **Rating Power**: Hold CIRQA to participate in scholarship rating and scoring
- **Governance Rights**: Vote on scholarship platform parameters and treasury allocation
- **Premium Features**: Access to advanced scholarship filtering and analytics

## Value Accrual Mechanisms

CIRQA's value is designed to grow with scholarship platform usage through several mechanisms:

### Fee Sharing

A portion of protocol fees is directed to CIRQA stakers:

- **Scholarship Funding Fees**: Protocol fees collected from scholarship funding transactions (default 1%)
- **Platform Utility**: Fees from premium features and advanced scholarship analytics
- **Rating Incentives**: A portion of fees used to reward active community raters

### Supply Dynamics

CIRQA implements mechanisms to manage token supply:

- **Buyback and Burn**: A portion of protocol fees is used to buy back and burn CIRQA tokens
- **Emission Adjustments**: Governance can adjust emission rates based on market conditions
- **Deflationary Mechanisms**: Certain protocol actions may burn CIRQA tokens

## Staking Mechanics

Staking CIRQA provides several benefits:

- **Staking Tiers**: Different benefits based on amount staked
- **Staking Duration**: Longer staking periods provide enhanced rewards
- **Staking Multipliers**: Active participation in governance increases staking rewards

### Staking Tiers

| Tier | CIRQA Required | Benefits |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Bronze | 1,000 CIRQA | Basic rating power, standard governance rights |
| Silver | 10,000 CIRQA | Enhanced rating weight, access to scholarship analytics |
| Gold | 100,000 CIRQA | Premium governance weight, early access to new features |
| Platinum | 1,000,000 CIRQA | Maximum governance weight, exclusive platform features |

## Emission Schedule

CIRQA tokens are distributed as rewards based on scholarship funding activity:

- **Funding Rewards**: 1 CIRQA per 1 USDT invested in scholarships (configurable by governance)
- **Rating Rewards**: Additional CIRQA for active participation in scholarship rating
- **Dynamic Distribution**: Emission rates adjust based on platform usage and governance decisions
- **Sustainable Model**: Long-term distribution designed to incentivize continued platform growth

The reward rate and emission parameters can be adjusted through governance proposals to maintain platform sustainability and growth.

## Treasury Management

The Community Treasury is a critical component of Cirqa's long-term sustainability:

- **Educational Initiatives**: Funding for educational programs and scholarship expansion
- **Platform Development**: Resources for new features and improvements
- **Community Incentives**: Additional rewards for high-quality scholarship applications and ratings
- **Marketing and Growth**: Resources for expanding the scholarship platform globally
- **Emergency Fund**: Reserves for platform security and student protection

All treasury expenditures are decided through governance votes by CIRQA token holders.

## Token Governance

CIRQA governance follows a structured process:

1. **Discussion**: Ideas are discussed in the community forum
2. **Temperature Check**: Informal polling to gauge community sentiment
3. **Formal Proposal**: On-chain proposal creation (requires minimum CIRQA holdings)
4. **Voting Period**: 7-day voting period for all CIRQA holders
5. **Implementation**: Successful proposals are implemented after a timelock period

For more details on governance, see the [Governance](governance.md) documentation.

## Economic Sustainability

Cirqa's tokenomics are designed for long-term sustainability:

- **Usage-Based Distribution**: Token rewards tied directly to scholarship funding activity
- **Fee Generation**: Growing fee revenue as more scholarships are funded
- **Educational Impact**: Value creation through real-world educational funding
- **Community Growth**: Self-sustaining ecosystem incentivizing quality participation
- **Governance Adaptability**: Ability to adjust parameters as the platform grows

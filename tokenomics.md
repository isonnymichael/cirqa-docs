The CIRQA token serves multiple functions within the ecosystem:

### Protocol Utility

- **Rating Power**: Hold CIRQA to participate in scholarship rating and scoring
- **Governance Rights**: Vote on scholarship platform parameters and treasury allocation
- **Premium Features**: Access to advanced scholarship filtering and analytics

## Value Accrual Mechanisms

CIRQA's value is designed to grow with scholarship platform usage through several mechanisms:

### Fee Sharing

A portion of protocol fees is directed to CIRQA stakers:

- **Scholarship Funding Fees**: Protocol fees collected from scholarship funding transactions (default 1%)
- **Platform Utility**: Fees from premium features and advanced scholarship analytics
- **Rating Incentives**: A portion of fees used to reward active community raters

### Supply Dynamics

CIRQA implements mechanisms to manage token supply:

- **Buyback and Burn**: A portion of protocol fees is used to buy back and burn CIRQA tokens

- **Deflationary Mechanisms**: Certain protocol actions may burn CIRQA tokens

## Staking Mechanics

Staking CIRQA provides several benefits:

- **Staking Tiers**: Different benefits based on amount staked
- **Staking Duration**: Longer staking periods provide enhanced rewards
- **Staking Multipliers**: Active participation in governance increases staking rewards

## Emission Schedule

CIRQA tokens are distributed as rewards based on scholarship funding activity:

- **Funding Rewards**: 1 CIRQA per 1 USDT invested in scholarships (configurable by governance)
- **Rating Rewards**: Additional CIRQA for active participation in scholarship rating
- **Dynamic Distribution**: Emission rates adjust based on platform usage and governance decisions
- **Sustainable Model**: Long-term distribution designed to incentivize continued platform growth

The reward rate and emission parameters can be adjusted through governance proposals to maintain platform sustainability and growth.

## Treasury Management

The Community Treasury is a critical component of Cirqa's long-term sustainability:

- **Educational Initiatives**: Funding for educational programs and scholarship expansion
- **Platform Development**: Resources for new features and improvements
- **Community Incentives**: Additional rewards for high-quality scholarship applications and ratings
- **Marketing and Growth**: Resources for expanding the scholarship platform globally
- **Emergency Fund**: Reserves for platform security and student protection

All treasury expenditures are decided through governance votes by CIRQA token holders.

## Economic Sustainability

Cirqa's tokenomics are designed for long-term sustainability:

- **Usage-Based Distribution**: Token rewards tied directly to scholarship funding activity
- **Fee Generation**: Growing fee revenue as more scholarships are funded
- **Educational Impact**: Value creation through real-world educational funding
- **Community Growth**: Self-sustaining ecosystem incentivizing quality participation
- **Governance Adaptability**: Ability to adjust parameters as the platform grows

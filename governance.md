Cirqa is governed by its community through a decentralized governance system. CIRQA token holders have the power to propose, discuss, and vote on changes to the protocol. This document outlines how governance works in Cirqa and how you can participate in shaping the future of the protocol.

## Governance Overview

Cirqa governance is designed to be:

- **Decentralized**: Decision-making power is distributed among token holders
- **Transparent**: All proposals and votes are publicly visible on-chain
- **Inclusive**: Any token holder can participate in governance
- **Secure**: Multi-tiered voting system with timelock mechanisms for security

## The CIRQA Token

The CIRQA token is the governance token of the Cirqa protocol. Holding CIRQA tokens grants you voting rights proportional to your holdings. The token serves several purposes:

- **Voting Power**: Each CIRQA token represents one vote in governance decisions
- **Proposal Creation**: Token holders can create governance proposals
- **Protocol Fee Discounts**: Token holders may receive discounts on protocol fees
- **Staking Rewards**: Tokens can be staked to earn a portion of protocol fees

## Governance Process

<div class="cirqa-note">

The Cirqa governance process follows a structured path from ideation to implementation, ensuring thorough discussion and consensus before changes are made to the protocol.

</div>

### 1. Ideation and Discussion

Governance begins with community discussions on the [Cirqa Forum](https://community.cirqa.io) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/cirqa). This is where ideas are refined and receive initial feedback.

### 2. Cirqa Improvement Proposals (CIPs)

Once an idea has gained traction, it is formalized as a Cirqa Improvement Proposal (CIP). A CIP should include:

- **Summary**: Brief overview of the proposal
- **Motivation**: Why the change is needed
- **Specification**: Detailed description of the proposed changes
- **Technical Implementation**: How the changes will be implemented
- **Economic Considerations**: Impact on the protocol's economics

### 3. Temperature Check

Before moving to a formal vote, proposals undergo a temperature check using a snapshot vote. This gauges community sentiment without requiring on-chain transactions.

### 4. Formal Proposal

If the temperature check is positive, the proposal moves to a formal on-chain proposal. To create a formal proposal, you need:

- A minimum of 100,000 CIRQA tokens (either held or delegated)
- A detailed proposal that has been discussed by the community

### 5. Voting Period

The voting period lasts for 7 days. During this time, CIRQA token holders can cast their votes:

- **For**: Support the proposal
- **Against**: Oppose the proposal
- **Abstain**: Neutral stance

### 6. Execution

If a proposal passes (more than 50% of votes in favor, with a quorum of at least 4% of total CIRQA supply), it enters a 2-day timelock before execution. This timelock provides a security buffer and allows users to exit the protocol if they disagree with the change.

## Types of Governance Proposals

Cirqa governance can vote on various aspects of the protocol, including:

- **Parameter Updates**: Adjusting interest rates, collateral factors, etc.
- **Asset Listings**: Adding new assets to the protocol
- **Protocol Upgrades**: Implementing new features or improvements
- **Treasury Management**: Allocating funds from the protocol treasury
- **Governance Changes**: Modifying the governance process itself

## Delegation

If you hold CIRQA tokens but don't want to actively participate in every vote, you can delegate your voting power to another address. This allows you to:

- Support delegates whose views align with yours
- Maintain voting power in the ecosystem without active management
- Contribute to governance even with smaller token holdings

## Governance Security

Cirqa governance includes several security measures:

- **Timelock**: All passed proposals have a 2-day delay before execution
- **Quorum Requirements**: Minimum participation thresholds for valid votes
- **Gradual Parameter Changes**: Limits on how much parameters can change in a single proposal
- **Emergency Council**: A multi-sig that can pause the protocol in emergencies (transitional feature)

## How to Participate

1. **Acquire CIRQA Tokens**: Purchase tokens on supported exchanges or earn them through protocol participation
2. **Join the Community**: Participate in discussions on the [Forum](https://community.cirqa.io) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/cirqa)
3. **Vote on Proposals**: Connect your wallet to the [Governance Portal](https://app.cirqa.io/governance) to vote
4. **Create Proposals**: Develop and submit your own proposals if you meet the token threshold
5. **Delegate Your Votes**: If you prefer not to vote directly, delegate your voting power

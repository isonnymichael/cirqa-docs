Security is a top priority for the Cirqa protocol. This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect user funds and ensure the integrity of the protocol. We employ multiple layers of security, including code audits, formal verification, economic security mechanisms, and ongoing monitoring.

</div>

## Security Overview

Cirqa's security approach is built on four pillars:

1. **Code Security**: Rigorous auditing and testing of smart contracts
2. **Economic Security**: Mechanisms to prevent attacks and ensure protocol solvency
3. **Operational Security**: Secure development practices and access controls
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous surveillance for potential threats

## Smart Contract Security

### Audits

All Cirqa smart contracts undergo comprehensive audits by leading security firms in the blockchain industry:

- **Audit Firm A**: Completed on [Date], [Link to Report]
- **Audit Firm B**: Completed on [Date], [Link to Report]
- **Audit Firm C**: Completed on [Date], [Link to Report]

<div class="cirqa-note">

Audits are a critical component of our security process, but they are just one layer of our comprehensive security approach. We also employ formal verification, economic analysis, and continuous monitoring.

</div>

### Formal Verification

Critical components of the Cirqa protocol have undergone formal verification, a mathematical approach to proving the correctness of the code:

- **Interest Rate Model**: Verified to ensure accurate interest calculations
- **Liquidation Logic**: Verified to ensure proper execution of liquidations
- **Token Transfer Logic**: Verified to ensure accurate token accounting

### Bug Bounty Program

Cirqa maintains an ongoing bug bounty program to incentivize the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities:

- **Critical**: Up to $250,000
- **High**: Up to $100,000
- **Medium**: Up to $50,000
- **Low**: Up to $10,000

## Economic Security

### Collateralization

Cirqa employs a robust collateralization system to ensure the solvency of the protocol:

- **Collateral Factors**: Each asset has a specific collateral factor determining how much can be borrowed against it
- **Liquidation Thresholds**: Clear thresholds for when positions become eligible for liquidation
- **Liquidation Incentives**: Economic incentives for liquidators to maintain protocol solvency

### Price Oracle Security

Price oracles are critical for determining collateral values and liquidation thresholds:

- **Multiple Data Sources**: Prices are derived from multiple reputable sources
- **Time-Weighted Average Prices**: To prevent flash loan attacks and price manipulation
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Backup systems in case primary price feeds fail
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic pausing of certain functions if extreme price movements are detected

### Risk Parameters

Risk parameters are carefully calibrated based on asset characteristics:

- **Asset Volatility**: More volatile assets have lower collateral factors
- **Market Liquidity**: Assets with lower liquidity have stricter borrowing limits
- **Historical Performance**: Risk parameters are informed by historical data
- **Stress Testing**: Regular stress tests to ensure protocol resilience

## Operational Security

### Access Controls

Strict access controls govern who can make changes to the protocol:

- **Timelocks**: All parameter changes are subject to timelock delays
- **Multi-signature Requirements**: Critical functions require multiple approvals
- **Role-Based Access**: Different functions have different access requirements

### Secure Development Practices

The Cirqa development team follows industry best practices:

- **Code Reviews**: All code changes undergo peer review
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive unit and integration tests
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on all code changes
- **Development Sandboxes**: Testing in isolated environments before deployment

## Ongoing Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring

Cirqa employs continuous monitoring systems to detect potential issues:

- **Transaction Monitoring**: Unusual transaction patterns are flagged for review
- **Health Factor Monitoring**: Tracking of user positions approaching liquidation
- **Market Condition Alerts**: Notifications for extreme market movements

### Incident Response

In the event of a security incident, Cirqa has a defined response process:

1. **Detection**: Identifying the issue through monitoring or reports
2. **Assessment**: Evaluating the severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Taking immediate actions to limit damage
4. **Resolution**: Implementing fixes and restoring normal operation
5. **Post-mortem**: Analyzing the incident and improving security measures

## Security Best Practices for Users

Users can enhance their security when interacting with Cirqa:

- **Use Hardware Wallets**: Store your assets on hardware wallets when possible
- **Monitor Your Positions**: Regularly check your health factor to avoid liquidation
- **Verify Transactions**: Always verify transaction details before signing
- **Use Official Interfaces**: Only interact with Cirqa through official websites and interfaces
- **Stay Informed**: Follow Cirqa's official communication channels for security updates

## Security Roadmap

Cirqa is committed to continuously improving security measures:

- **Additional Audits**: Regular security audits as the protocol evolves
- **Enhanced Formal Verification**: Expanding formal verification coverage
- **Decentralized Oracle Network**: Moving towards more decentralized price feeds
- **Advanced Risk Models**: Developing more sophisticated risk assessment models

DeFi protocols involve inherent risks. Always do your own research, understand the risks involved, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the Cirqa documentation. Understanding these terms will help you navigate the protocol more effectively and make informed decisions when using Cirqa's lending and borrowing services.

## A

### APY (Annual Percentage Yield)
The effective annual rate of return taking into account the effect of compounding interest. In Cirqa, APY refers to the annualized return for lenders or the cost for borrowers.

### Asset
Any token that can be supplied to or borrowed from the Cirqa protocol. Assets can include cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and tokenized real-world assets.

## B

### Borrow APY
The annualized interest rate that borrowers pay on their loans, expressed as a percentage.

### Borrow Cap
The maximum amount of an asset that can be borrowed from the protocol, set to manage risk and ensure liquidity.

### Borrowing Power
The total value a user can borrow based on their supplied collateral and the collateral factors of those assets.

## C

### Cirqa Token (CIRQA)
The native governance token of the Cirqa protocol, used for voting on protocol changes and receiving certain benefits within the ecosystem.

### Collateral
Assets supplied to the protocol that secure borrowed positions. If a borrower's health factor drops below 1, their collateral may be liquidated.

### Collateral Factor
The percentage of an asset's value that can be borrowed against when used as collateral. For example, an asset with a 75% collateral factor allows users to borrow up to 75% of the asset's value.

## D

### DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
A financial system built on blockchain technology that operates without centralized intermediaries like banks or financial institutions.

### Delegation
The process of assigning your voting power (via CIRQA tokens) to another address to vote on your behalf in governance decisions.

## E

### ERC-20
A technical standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Most assets in Cirqa follow this standard or its equivalent on other blockchains.

## F

### Flash Loan
A loan that is borrowed and repaid within a single transaction, typically used for arbitrage opportunities or collateral swaps.

## G

### Gas
The computational fee required to execute transactions on a blockchain network.

### Governance
The system by which decisions about the Cirqa protocol are made, primarily through voting by CIRQA token holders.

## H

### Health Factor
A numeric representation of the safety of a user's borrowed position relative to their collateral value. A health factor below 1 makes the position eligible for liquidation.

## I

### Interest Rate Model
The algorithm that determines borrowing and lending rates based on the utilization rate of each asset pool.

### IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)
A protocol that enables communication between different blockchain networks, allowing Cirqa to operate across multiple chains in the Cosmos ecosystem.

## K

### KiiChain
The primary blockchain network where Cirqa is deployed, offering fast transactions and low fees.

## L

### Liquidation
The process of selling a borrower's collateral to repay their loan when their health factor falls below 1.

### Liquidation Penalty
An additional fee charged during liquidation, typically ranging from 5-15% depending on the asset.

### Liquidity
The availability of assets in the protocol for borrowing or withdrawing.

### LTV (Loan-to-Value) Ratio
The ratio of a loan amount to the value of the collateral securing it, expressed as a percentage.

## M

### Market
A specific asset pool within Cirqa where users can supply or borrow a particular token.

## O

### Oracle
A service that provides external data to the blockchain, such as asset prices, which are critical for calculating collateral values and health factors.

### Origination Fee
A one-time fee charged when a user borrows an asset from the protocol.

## P

### Protocol Fee
A percentage of the interest paid by borrowers that goes to the protocol treasury instead of to suppliers.

## Q

### Quorum
The minimum number of votes required for a governance proposal to be valid, typically expressed as a percentage of the total token supply.

## R

### Reserve Factor
The percentage of interest paid by borrowers that is kept as reserves to protect the protocol against shortfalls.

### RWA (Real-World Asset)
Traditional assets like real estate, commodities, or securities that have been tokenized and brought onto the blockchain.

## S

### Smart Contract
Self-executing code deployed on a blockchain that automatically enforces and executes the terms of an agreement.

### Staking
Locking up CIRQA tokens to earn rewards and gain additional benefits within the protocol.

### Supply APY
The annualized interest rate earned by users who supply assets to the protocol, expressed as a percentage.

## T

### Timelock
A security mechanism that enforces a delay between when a governance proposal is approved and when it is executed.

### Total Value Locked (TVL)
The total value of all assets supplied to the Cirqa protocol, expressed in a common unit (usually USD).

## U

### Utilization Rate
The percentage of supplied assets that are currently being borrowed in a specific market. This rate directly influences interest rates.

## V

### Voting Power
The influence a user has in governance decisions, proportional to the amount of CIRQA tokens they hold or have delegated to them.

## W

### Wallet
A digital tool that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies, as well as interact with decentralized applications like Cirqa.

## Y

### Yield
The return earned on an investment, typically expressed as an annual percentage rate.
